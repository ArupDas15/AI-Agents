🔥 Start Here (Weekend Warriors)
HuggingFace Agents → https://lnkd.in/g6WZGKMf
Skip to Module 3. Trust me.

Anthropic MCP → https://lnkd.in/gmi8axUA
Their docs suck. This course doesn't.

🛠️ The Build Phase
RAG That Works → https://lnkd.in/gF2T7Bcz
Not toy examples. Real implementations.

Vector DBs (Pinecone) → https://lnkd.in/gtKFAcdK
Because embeddings need a home.

Agent Memory → https://lnkd.in/gM8bjwcx
The difference between demos and products.

⚡ Production Reality
LLMOps → https://lnkd.in/gHR9N-pR
aka "Why localhost betrayed you"

Evaluating Agents → [https://lnkd.in/g4BPnVfY)
Measure twice, ship once.

Multi-Agent Orchestration → [https://lnkd.in/g2hjW72r)
When one agent isn't enough chaos.

🧠 Advanced Territory
Berkeley Agent MOOC → [https://lnkd.in/gi6UNVQT)
Academic but worth it.

Advanced Agents (Berkeley) → https://lnkd.in/gr8HNPTH
PhD-level pain. You've been warned.

Computer Use (Anthropic) → https://lnkd.in/gt-xcdjf
Agents that click buttons. Wild times.
